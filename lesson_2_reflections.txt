1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git folder is created making the directory a git repository.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains my files and documents while the staging area and
the repository are two concepts of git.
Don't really know yet about the difference between the staging area and the
repository.
UPDATE: Maybe the staging area is a place to collect everything you later want
to commit to the repository. That would make sense.
