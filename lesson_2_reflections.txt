1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git folder is created making the directory a git repository.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains my files and documents while the staging area and
the repository are two concepts of git.
Don't really know yet about the difference between the staging area and the
repository.
UPDATE: Maybe the staging area is a place to collect everything you later want
to commit to the repository. That would make sense.


3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
 change?

It is possible to add just the files you want to the staging area and make sure
they are logical connected.


4)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful when i want to make changes but still want the actual
version to stay untouched.


5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help by showing me at which point a new branch was created and which commits
each branch contains.

6) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The result of merging two branches together is one branch, containing all the
changes made in these branches. That's exactly, what the the digram represents
graphically.
