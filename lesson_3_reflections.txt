1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

-   If i want to collaborate with other people and want everybody to work on the
    same code.
-   Using a remote repository serves as a kind of backup as well since it safes all
    my files on a remote server.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since your remote repository is visible to other people, you may want to decide
by yourself when to push to your remote repository.
On the other hand you may don't want a change made to the remote repository
pulled to your local one without checking it first.
